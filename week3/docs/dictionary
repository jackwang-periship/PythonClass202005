What Dictionaries Can Do
Dictionaries are another example of a data structure, and ,like lists, they are one of the most commonly
used data structures in programming. A dictionary is used to map or associate things you want to store
to keys you need to get them. Again, programmers don’t use a term like ”dictionary” for something
that doesn’t work like an actual dictionary full of words, so let’s use that as our real world example.
Let’s say you want to find out what the word ”Honorificabilitudinitatibus” means. Today you would
simply copy-paste that word into a search engine and then find out the answer, and we could say a
search engine is like a really huge super complex version of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Before
search engines what you would do is this:
1. Go to your library and get ”the dictionary”. Let’s say it’s the OED.
2. You know ”honorificabilitudinitatibus” starts with the letter ’H’ so you look on the side of the
book for the little tab that has ’H’ on it.
3. Then you’d skim the pages until you are close to where ”hon” started.
4. Then you’d skim a few more pages until you found ”honorificabilitudinitatibus” or hit the beginning
of the ”hp” words and realize this word isn’t in the OED.
5. Once you found the entry, you’d read the definition to figure out what it means.
This process is nearly exactly the way a dict works, and you are basically ”mapping” the word ”honorificabilitudinitatibus”
to its definition. A dict in Python is just like a dictionary in the real world such as
the OED.
