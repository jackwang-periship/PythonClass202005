Chocolates

Surprisingly delicate to ship, there are a number of factors to consider when dealing with chocolate.
Firstly, chocolate is very sensitive to temperature; it begins melting at 90 degrees Fahrenheit when the cocoa butter starts to heat, and melts completely between 104 - 113 degrees Fahrenheit.
It's also sensitive to moisture and humidity levels above 50%.
Chocolate needs to be stored properly away from heat, light, and other foods.
Strong odors can be absorbed by the chocolate and potentially ruin its taste.
If the chocolate is stored improperly an effect called “blooming” will take place.
Blooming takes place when the chocolate absorbs enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration and fat or sugar crystals rise to the surface.
In addition, when the chocolate is subject to extreme temperatures it will develop an oily texture.
Although this phenomenon makes the chocolate visually unappealing, it is still safe for consumption.
