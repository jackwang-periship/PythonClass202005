A tuple is a data structure that is an immutable, or unchangeable, ordered sequence of elements.
Because tuples are immutable, their values cannot be modified.

Tuples are used for grouping data. Each element or value that is inside of a tuple is called an item.

Tuples have values between parentheses ( ) separated by commas ,.
Empty tuples will appear as coral = (), but tuples with even one value must use a comma as in coral = ('blue coral',).

The differences between tuples and lists are:

    the tuples cannot be changed. Re:
        This means that items cannot be added to or removed from tuples, and items cannot be replaced within tuples

    Whereis you can remove item, add items to th lists , also lists use square brackets.

Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values.
Optionally you can put these comma-separated values between parentheses also
