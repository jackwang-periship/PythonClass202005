Cheese

While cheese falls under the category of "dairy" it really deserves its own section.
In general, cheeses of all types ship very well year-round; however,
a distinction needs to be made between "hard" and "soft" cheese -- and further still between hard,
semi-hard, soft, and semi-soft cheeses. Basically, hard cheeses are made from unpasteurized milk
and are aged (ripened) which depletes moisture and makes them drier.
These cheeses easily ship year-round (even in Summer!) with extended transit and do not require gels.
Although refrigeration is not required it is recommended.
It's important to know the mindset of your customers: in the US most people believe cheeses need to be kept cold and may refuse a shipment that was not refrigerated.
In this case a refrigerated gel contained inside the package is advised.

Most cheeses made in the US are soft cheeses made with pasteurized milk.
As the product is more uniform and consistent,
they also ship well year-round but need refrigerated gels and transit becomes more limited in the summer.
