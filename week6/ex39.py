# You create a function to calculate the power of a number by using Python.
# You need to ensure that the function is documented with comments.
# You create the following code. Line numbers are included for reference only.

# The calc_power function calculates exponents
# x is the base
# y is the exponent
# The value of x raised to the y power is returned

def calc_power(x, y):
    comment = "#Return the value"
    return x**y # raise x to the y power

# For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.
# Hot Area:

# A. Line# 5 to Line# 8 will be ignored for syntax checking       Y or N
# B. The pound sign (#) is optional for line# 6 and line# 7       Y or N
