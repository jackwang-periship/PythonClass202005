# The ABC company is creating a program that allows customers to log the number of miles biked.
# The program will send messages based on how many miles the customer logs.
# You create the following Python code. Line numbers are included for reference only.

    name = input("What is your name? ")
    return name

    calories = miles * calories_per_mile
    return calories

distance = int(input("How many miles did you bike this week? "))
burn_rate = 50

biker = get_name()
calories_burned = calc_calories(distance, burn_rate)
print(biker, ", you burned about", calories_burned, "calories.")

# You need to define the two required functions.
# Which code segments should you use for line 05 and line 08?
# Each correct answer presents part of the solution? (Choose two.)

# A. 01 def get_name():
# B. 01 def get_name(biker):
# C. 01 def get_name(name):
# D. 04 def calc_calories():
# E. 04 def calc_calories(miles, burn_rate):
# F. 04 def calc_calories(miles, calories_per_mile):
