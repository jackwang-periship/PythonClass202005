# This question requires that you evaluate the underlined text to determine if it is correct.
# You write the following code:

# import sys
# try:
#     file_in = open("in.txt", "r")
#     file_out = open("out.txt", "w+")
# except IOError:
#     print("Cannot open", file_name)
# else:
#     i = 1
#     for line in file_in:
#         print(line.rstrip())
#         file_out.write("Line " + str(i) + ": " + line)
#         i = i + 1
#     file_in.close()
#     file_out.close()

# The out.txt file does not exist. You run the code. The code will execute without error.
# Review the underlined text. If it makes the statement correct, select No change is needed.
# If the statement is incorrect, select the answer choice that makes the statement correct.
